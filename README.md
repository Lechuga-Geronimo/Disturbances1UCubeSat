# Enviromental Disturbances Simulation and Determination for a 1U CubeSat.
This project is about the determination and simulation of enviromental disturbances for a 1U CubeSat. 

I started reviewing the state-of-art related to disturbances that a satellite (and more like, a CubeSat) may suffer in orbit. The main four are Aerodynamic Drag, Solar Pressure, Magnetic Torque and Gravitatory Torque.

After determining the applicable equations that describes this effects, I started the simulations in Matlab in order to estimate the magnitude and impact in the satellite.

## Solar Pressure.

## Aerodynamic Drag.

## Torques and forces. 

Different results depending the angle of CubeSat. All in Matlab.
